## Project structure

To structure the project following a vertical architecture, where each feature is organized into its own package, you can follow these guidelines:

### Project Layout

The project root directory should contain essential files like “README.md”, “requirements.txt” and the configuration “.env.*” files.
Common functionality such **configuration** and **logging** also should be on root level.

### Package Structure

Create a directory name “features” to hold all feature-related packages.

Each feature, such as “users”, “recipes”, “images” and etc should have it own sub package under  the “feature” directory.

### Feature Package Structure

Inside each feature package, organize your code into the following structure:

- “router”: Define API endpoints and request handling
- “models”: Define feature-specific data models.
- “operations”: Implement business logic for the feature
- “input_models”: Define input data validation and serialization
- “responses”: Define response data structures

### Testing

Create a separate directory for tests, with a similar structure to your source code.

For example, you can have “tests/features” mirroring the “features/” structure
